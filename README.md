Time series forecasting and demand planning for daily-level FMCG sales transactions 

This project focuses on forecasting sales performance for a Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company using a real-world dataset. It demonstrates how to preprocess raw transactional data with Python (Pandas), analyze patterns in Excel pivot tables, and build interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize trends and predictions.

# Problem Statement

FMCG businesses rely on accurate sales forecasts to:

- Plan inventory and avoid stockouts.
- Optimize supply chain operations.
- Anticipate seasonal demand shifts.
- Improve decision-making for pricing and promotions.

This project addresses the question: *“What will sales look like in the coming months, and which products or regions will drive them?”*
